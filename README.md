# Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing skills, projects, and experiences. Built with **Next.js**, leveraging modern development practices and optimized for performance.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Preview

You can start editing the pages by modifying the files in the `pages` or `app` (if using the app router) directory. The application auto-updates as you edit the files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
