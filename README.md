# Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing skills, projects, and experiences. Built with **Next.js**, leveraging modern development practices and optimized for performance.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or your preferred package manager (e.g., `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

### Editing the Project

You can start editing the pages by modifying the files in the `pages` or `app` directory (if you're using the app router). The application auto-updates as you edit the files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
